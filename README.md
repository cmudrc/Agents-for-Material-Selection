# Evaluating the Effectiveness of Large Language Model Powered Agents for Material Selection

## Abstract

Material selection is fundamental to the design process, as it significantly impacts a productâ€™s cost, performance, appearance, and manufacturability. It is a complex, open-ended challenge that forces designers to continuously adapt to new information, balance diverse stakeholder demands, weigh trade-offs, and navigate uncertainties to achieve the optimal outcome. Previous studies have explored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the material selection process, with findings suggesting that LLMs could provide valuable support. However, discrepancies between LLM outputs and expert recommendations indicate the need for further research. To address the limitations of LLMs, AI agents have been developed by building additional capabilities on top of LLMs, allowing them to retrieve and analyze external information, use specialized tools for reasoning, and refine their outputs based on iterative feedback. This study investigates how LLM-powered agents, equipped with advanced search tools, can more effectively emulate expert decision-making, offering insights into the integration of AI into the design process.
